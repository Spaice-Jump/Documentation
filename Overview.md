## The PROJECT: _Space Jump_
SPACE JUMP PROJECT is a space travel platform with which travel agencies, space companies, and space tourists interact.

The functionalities of the platform are similar to those of Wallapop, where trips to space can be offered, and where specific trips can be requested. Travel offers are published by travel agencies and space companies, and are booked by tourists. The opposite happens with travel requests: tourists publish and agencies hire.

The platform allows you to mark favorites, book trips, communicate with the owner of the offer or demand. All of these options require registration in the system. It is also possible to browse the platform as an anonymous user without registration.
